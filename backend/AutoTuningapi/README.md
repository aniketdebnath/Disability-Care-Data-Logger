Signal Quality Tuning and Optimization Using Random Forest Regressor
This project focuses on optimizing hardware signal quality for a pulse oximeter setup using a Random Forest Regressor (RFR). The key objective is to identify the optimal tuning parameters, such as LED currents, TIA gain, and TIA CF, to achieve the best signal quality. The project employs a pre-trained RFR model to evaluate signal quality based on incoming hardware data and iteratively adjusts the tuning parameters to enhance signal accuracy.

Why Use a Random Forest Regressor?
Random Forest Regressors are particularly effective for regression tasks involving noisy or complex data due to their ability to reduce overfitting and handle outliers. By averaging the results from multiple decision trees, Random Forests provide more robust predictions. Additionally, they allow for feature importance analysis, which helps identify key factors contributing to signal quality.

In this project, we use an RFR model with pre-determined hyperparameters optimized for the pulse oximeter hardware.

Random Forest Regressor Configuration
The Random Forest Regressor model is configured with the following hyperparameters:

rf_model = RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,   # Number of trees in the forest
    max_depth=None,     # Unlimited depth, allowing trees to grow to their maximum
    min_samples_split=10, # Minimum samples required to split an internal node
    min_samples_leaf=5, # Minimum samples required at a leaf node
    random_state=42     # For reproducibility
)

Explanation of Hyperparameters
n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest. After experimentation, we set this to 100, which yielded optimal results for signal quality evaluation.
max_depth: This parameter controls the maximum depth of each tree. Setting it to None allows trees to grow fully, capturing complex relationships in the signal data.
min_samples_split: Determines the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node. A value of 10 helps prevent overfitting by ensuring nodes have sufficient samples before splitting.
min_samples_leaf: Specifies the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node. A value of 5 avoids creating overly small leaf nodes that can lead to overfitting.
Signal Quality Evaluation
The model assesses the quality of incoming hardware signals by processing data from the pulse oximeter's LED sensors (Green and IR). After filtering the signals using a band-pass filter, the model predicts a quality score for each signal segment. The median and interquartile range (IQR) of the quality scores are used to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different tuning parameters.

Signal Quality Metrics
Median Quality: The median of the predicted quality scores indicates the central tendency of the signal quality.
Interquartile Range (IQR): Measures the spread of the predicted quality scores. A lower IQR indicates less variability and a more stable signal.
Tuning Strategy
The system employs an iterative tuning strategy based on the signal quality metrics. During each iteration:

The model processes the signals and predicts quality scores.
The median and IQR of the predicted scores are computed.
The system adjusts the tuning parameters, such as LED currents and TIA gain, based on whether improvements are detected.
The following adjustments are made if improvements are needed:

LED Currents: Incremented or decremented by small steps to achieve optimal brightness for signal detection.
TIA Gain and TIA CF: Adjusted within a predefined range to fine-tune signal amplification and filtering.
Decision Criteria for Improvement
To determine if the tuning process is making progress, the model checks for improvements in the median and IQR values:

def is_improving(median_quality, iqr_quality, baseline_median, baseline_iqr, tolerance=0.05):
    """Check if the signal quality is improving based on median and IQR values."""
    median_improvement = (median_quality - baseline_median) / baseline_median > tolerance
    iqr_reduction = (baseline_iqr - iqr_quality) / baseline_iqr > tolerance
    return median_improvement and iqr_reduction


Plateau Detection
If no notable improvements are detected after a series of iterations, the system applies the best-found tuning parameters and sets the AutoTuneIdeal flag to True. This approach prevents unnecessary adjustments and stabilizes the signal quality.

Integration with FastAPI
The entire project is integrated into a larger software solution using FastAPI for deployment and real-time monitoring. FastAPI endpoints allow remote interaction with the signal tuning system, making it easier to monitor performance, apply updates, and retrieve tuning results.

Sample Endpoint
from fastapi import FastAPI
from app.routers import tuning

app = FastAPI()

app.include_router(tuning.router)

@app.get("/")
def root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to the Signal Tuning API"}
