ECG Abnormality Detection Using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier

This project focuses on detecting cardiac arrhythmias and abnormalities in ECG signals using a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. The dataset includes essential features such as RR intervals, heart rate, and QRS duration, which are critical for identifying conditions such as Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC), Bundle Branch Blocks (LBBB, RBBB), and Ventricular Fibrillation. The KNN model is fine-tuned using hyperparameter optimization to enhance the detection of abnormal heartbeats.
Why Use K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)?

K-Nearest Neighbors is a straightforward yet powerful algorithm that classifies data points based on the closest training examples in the feature space. It is particularly effective in situations where the decision boundary is complex or when dealing with multi-class problems. KNN is advantageous because it:

    Adapts Easily: It can easily adapt to different datasets and is non-parametric, meaning it makes no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
    Handles Multidimensional Data: KNN works well with high-dimensional data, making it suitable for ECG signals with multiple features.

Workflow Overview

    Data Normalization: The features are normalized using StandardScaler() to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This scaling improves KNN performance since the algorithm relies on distance calculations.

    KNN Classifier: The KNN model is trained with the following configuration:

    python

KNN Classifier Parameters

    n_neighbors:
        Definition: This parameter determines the number of nearest neighbors to consider when classifying a data point.
        Explanation: In the KNN algorithm, each data point's class is determined based on the classes of its nearest neighbors. The value of n_neighbors can significantly affect the model's performance:
            Low Values (e.g., 1): With n_neighbors=1, the model will classify a point based solely on the closest training example. This can lead to a more flexible model that captures local patterns but is sensitive to noise and outliers.
            High Values: Increasing n_neighbors will average out the influence of the nearest points, leading to a smoother decision boundary. However, too high a value may cause the model to overlook local patterns, potentially leading to underfitting.

    weights:
        Definition: This parameter determines how the contribution of each neighbor is weighted when making predictions.
        Options:
            'uniform': All neighbors contribute equally to the classification decision, regardless of their distance from the query point.
            'distance': Closer neighbors have a greater influence on the classification than those further away. This can be beneficial in scenarios where proximity is a strong indicator of class membership, as it allows the model to focus on the most relevant neighbors.

    metric:
        Definition: This parameter specifies the distance metric used to compute the distance between data points.
        Options:
            'euclidean': This is the most common distance metric, which calculates the straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space. It is sensitive to the scale of the data and works well for continuous variables.
            'manhattan': Also known as the L1 distance, it calculates the distance between points by summing the absolute differences of their coordinates. It can be more robust to outliers than the Euclidean metric, making it a good choice in certain contexts.

Example of KNN Parameter Configuration

In the context of the ECG abnormality detection project, the KNN model is set up as follows:

python

knn_model = KNeighborsClassifier(
    n_neighbors=11,         # The number of neighbors considered for voting
    weights='distance',     # Closer neighbors have a higher influence on the classification
    metric='manhattan'      # Using the Manhattan distance metric for distance calculations
)

Why These Parameters Were Chosen

    n_neighbors=11: This value was chosen based on empirical testing, where odd numbers help avoid ties in class voting. Having more than one neighbor balances the influence of nearby points and helps in better generalization without being overly sensitive to noise.

    weights='distance': By giving more weight to closer neighbors, the model can better respond to local patterns in the data, which is crucial when dealing with complex ECG signals.

    metric='manhattan': The Manhattan distance was chosen for its robustness to outliers, which can be common in ECG data. This metric helps in capturing the essence of the data's distribution while being less affected by extreme values.

Hyperparameter Tuning (Grid Search): To improve the modelâ€™s performance, GridSearchCV is utilized to fine-tune the hyperparameters. The parameter grid consists of:

python

param_grid = {
    'n_neighbors': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11],  # Testing odd numbers for k to avoid ties
    'weights': ['uniform', 'distance'],  # Uniform weights or distance-based weights
    'metric': ['euclidean', 'manhattan']  # Distance metrics
}

    n_neighbors: The number of neighbors to consider for voting.
    weights: Defines how votes are weighted (uniform or distance).
    metric: The distance metric to be used (Euclidean or Manhattan).

Code for Hyperparameter Tuning:

python

    grid = GridSearchCV(KNeighborsClassifier(), param_grid, cv=5, verbose=2)
    grid.fit(X_train, y_train)

    The best parameters found were {'metric': 'manhattan', 'n_neighbors': 11, 'weights': 'distance'}, which improved the model's performance.

    Model Evaluation: After training the KNN classifier and applying hyperparameter tuning, the model is evaluated using confusion matrices and classification reports.
